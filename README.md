The player begins with no minions and must summon them using a summoning box. Once summoned, minions can:

Follow the player

Receive commands to interact with the environment

Carry and deliver objects by attaching them to predefined points

This system is designed as a foundation for more complex real-time strategy and action-adventure mechanics.

⚙️ Features
Summoning Mechanic – bring minions into the world dynamically

Minion Following – smooth follow behavior to maintain formation and responsiveness

Command System – basic AI responding to player-issued orders

Object Pickup & Delivery – objects attach seamlessly to minions without physics glitches, moving as one with the minion

Scalable Architecture – clean structure to allow easy expansion of new minion types and abilities

🛠️ Tech Stack
Engine: Unity

Language: C#

Version Control: GitHub

🚀 Future Plans
Add combat mechanics for minions

Expand command types (attack, defend, hold position, etc.)

Introduce different minion classes with unique abilities

Enhance UI feedback for player-issued commands
